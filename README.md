# Advanced-Forest-Fire-Detection-via-Image-Processing-and-ML-SVM-Random-Forest-in-MATLAB
This project presents an advanced forest fire detection system using digital image processing and machine learning in MATLAB. It extracts key visual features from images and classifies fire regions using SVM and Random Forest models, enabling fast and accurate early detection of forest fires.
